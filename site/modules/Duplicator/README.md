### Instructions

1. Download the module from the [directory](https://modules.processwire.com/modules/duplicator/) or [Github]()
2. Drop the module files in /site/modules/Duplicator/
3. In your admin, click Modules > Refresh
4. Click "install" for "Duplicator"
5. Optional. Click "install" for "Duplicator - Packages Manager"
6. Go to Setup > Duplicator and build your package!

### SDK Installation (optional)
You can skip these instructions if you plan to only use the built-in features `Local Folder` or `FTP/FTPS`.

If you want to use `GoogleDrive` or `AmazonS3`, you have two choices of type of installation. Using Composer or downloading directly a ZIP archive from the repository.

Installing all SDK are not required, you can choose the one you need.

###### Note:
- `Dropbox` dropped support for the version 1 of the API since september 2017 - [api-v1-deprecation-timeline](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2017/06/updated-api-v1-deprecation-timeline/) - so I removed it from Duplicator until I got the time to code an interface for the API v2
- `GoogleDrive` tested the 2017-12-03 `successfully`
- `AmazonS3` tested the 2017-12-03 `successfully`

#### Using Composer
In the root directory of your ProcessWire installation, just type in a terminal :
* `composer require google/apiclient`
* `composer require aws/aws-sdk-php`

#### ZIP Archive
After downloading the archive, open it, you will find a folder called **`SDKs`** under each provider named directory. Extract or Upload this folder in the **`Duplicator module folder`**. If the folder already exist, merge it. Example: `/www/public_html/site/modules/Duplicator/SDKs`

Download it from the [**Duplicator-SDKs**](https://github.com/flydev-fr/Duplicator-SDKs/archive/master.zip) repository.


Now you can refresh the Duplicator's settings page, the corresponding checkbox will be enabled.


# Installing a CRON job
Actually you have 3 choices to setup a cron job.

## System CRON
###### The standard way
To edit a crontab through the command line, type: `cronjob -e` then add for example the following line to build a package once a day :
> `4 0 * * * php /www/mysite/wwwroot/site/modules/Duplicator/cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1`


## PwCron
###### modules
You can rely on [PwCron](https://modules.processwire.com/modules/pwcron/) to setup the job.
> `4 0 * * * php /www/mysite/wwwroot/site/modules/PwCron/cron.php >/dev/null 2>&1`

## LazyCron
###### modules
Because it's triggered by a pageview, this choice can slowdown your site - [LazyCron documentation](https://modules.processwire.com/modules/lazy-cron/)

#### Notes :
###### For Windows
Please look at this answer on stackoverflow to set up it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7195503/setting-up-a-cron-job-in-windows

###### Using a control panel ?
If you are running CRON via a panel, please rely on the documentation of your hosting provider. Do not hesitate to ping on the support forum thread.

###### Some hosting companies donâ€™t allow access to cron
If this the case, you can rely on [LazyCron](https://processwire.com/api/modules/lazy-cron/) module.


##### Example CRON delay table:

| When | Settings |
| -------- | -------- |
| Every 1 minute   | */1 * * * *   |
| Every 15 minutes   | */15 * * * *   |
| Every 30 minutes |	*/30 * * * *
| Every 1 hour |	0 * * * * |
| Every 6 hours |	0 */6 * * * |
| Every 12 hours |	0 */12 * * * |
| Once a day |	4 0 * * * |
| Once a week |	4 0 * * 0 |
| Once a month |	4 0 1 * * |


# Providers Settings

## GoogleDrive
Obtain credentials there: [https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)

A tutorial is available on the forum :  [Duplicator Dev Thread](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/15345-duplicator-backup-and-move-sites/?page=2#comment-139376)

## AmazonS3
Obtain credentials there: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)

#### Note:
A **bucket name** should conform with **DNS requirements**:
* Should not contain uppercase characters
* Should not contain underscores (_)
* Should be between 3 and 63 characters long
* Should not end with a dash
* Cannot contain two, adjacent periods
* Cannot contain dashes next to periods (e.g., "my-.bucket.com" and "my.-bucket" are invalid)


# Issues

## Timeout
Timeout usually happen if you are on a low-end budget host with limitations. The easiest way to solve this issue, is to use directory filters on some of your larger directories like your `files`, `vendor`, or even `bower_components` directory to get the size down. Then reinstall the package at the new location and then FTP all the files over that you filtered.

**Hosting Provider Issue List:**
* 1and1 Shared hosting (resolved by using Filters)
* Dreamhost hosting (resolved using the `Archive Flush` option); Need to be tested again.
