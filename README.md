aims to help developers find useful jQuery snippets to speed up the development process. It is also useful to learn something new and fun for next development project. Every day we publish new snippets which we find interesting and we also publish useful jQuery plugins. We have big plans for the future. We want to create a learning platform specializing in frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Ember etc.).
